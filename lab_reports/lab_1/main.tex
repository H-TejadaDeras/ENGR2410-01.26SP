\section{Experiment 1: Resistance Measurement}
	\subsection{Results}
	% Elias - Make a plot showing both the measured data (as individual points) and the theoretical fit (as a solid line) along with the extracted resistance value.

    \subsection{Analysis}
	% Henry - Comment on any discrepancies and suggest possible explanations for them.
	\subsection{Discussion}
    The nominal resistance value of the resistor was 1.5k$\Omega$ with a 5\% tolerance. The resistance measured by the SourceMeter was 1.48377 k$\Omega$, which has a percent error of 1.08\% which is less than the 5\% tolerance. However the SourceMeter is still subject to a small error rate because while it aims to approximate an ideal voltmeter, it will not truly be infinite resistance. Additionally the resistor itself is subject to a small error rate because of the manufacturing process. In the curve fit plot, the value is likely more accurate because it is based on multiple values of voltage and current. However, there is still some error because of inaccuracy in measurements and the small resistance in wires. However the fact that the value by the SourceMeter is similar to the value from the curve fit plot suggests that both these methods result in a value that is close to the true resistance of the resistor
    % Anika - Which technique do you think is the most accurate? Why?
	tmp below...
	Color Code Resistance Value: 1.5 k$\Omega$ with a 5\% tolerance. Keithley Measured Resistance Value: 1.48377 k$\Omega$

\section{Experiment 2: Resistive Voltage Division}
	\subsection{Results}
	% Henry - Within a single chip, how do the resistances match each other compared to the ±2% tolerance specified for their absolute values? How do the resistance values on one chip compare to those on the second chip? In your report, include a table showing all of the resistor values from both chips. Make a plot showing both the measured data and the theoretical fit along with the extracted value of the divider ratio.
	\subsection{Analysis}
	% Anika - How does the actual divider ratio compare to the theoretical one?
	\subsection{Discussion}
	% Elias - Is this discrepancy consistent with the level of resistance mismatch that you observed in your resistor array?
	tmp below ...
	Within a single chip, the standard deviation of the resistance between the isolated resistors was about 0.56\% with a range of 0.73. This is within the $\pm$2\% tolerance of the chip.

\section{Experiment 3: Resistive Current Division}
	\subsection{Results}
	% Anika - Make a plot showing both the measured data and the theoretical fit along with the extracted value of the divider ratio. 
	\subsection{Analysis}
	% Elias - How does the actual divider ratio compare to the theoretical one?
	\subsection{Discussion}
	% Henry - Is this discrepancy consistent with the level of resistance mismatch that you observed in your resistor array?

\section{Experiment 4: R-2R Ladder Network}
	\subsection{Results}
	% Anika - Enter your measurements into MATLAB and make a semilog plot of current as a function of position for both measurements on a single graph along with appropriate theoretical expected values.
	\subsection{Analysis}
	% Henry - Do these currents vary with position as you expect?
	\subsection{Discussion}
	% Elias - Do these currents vary with position as you expect?
